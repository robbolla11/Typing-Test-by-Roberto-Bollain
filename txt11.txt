When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hemp for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said "all you ever think about is sex"
I'm like oh well
You know me so well
